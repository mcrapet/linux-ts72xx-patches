# Linux kernel patches for TS-72XX

I have been working (for personnal purpose) on ARM9 EP93XX architecture since 2004. 
I played a lot with [Technologic Systems](https://www.embeddedarm.com/) SBCs and oriented my job as embedded engineer.

You'll find here some old stuff (2008-2010) I've been working on.

See different git branches matching kernel version:
* linux-2.6.34
* linux-2.6.32.3
* linux-2.6.32-rc3
* linux-2.6.29.1
* linux-2.6.28.3
* linux-2.6.27.4
* linux-2.6.24.4

Only patches are committed here, you'll have to download [vanilla kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) on your own.

This repository is discontinued. It's just _pour le souvenir_, Raspberry PI wasn't born yet!
