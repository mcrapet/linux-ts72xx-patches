Release notes about "linux-2.6.27.4-ts7200_matt-4" patch
This is mainly created for EP9301 & EP9302 CPUs and more especially for TS-7200, TS-7250 & TS-7260
SBCs manufactured by Technologic Systems (http://www.embeddedarm.com).

As 2.6.28 is out. This is the last patch release!

Content
=======

  EP93xx processor
  ----------------
  - Ethernet
  - RTC (no backed up RAM)
  - I2C (based on gpio)
  - SPI (master driver)
  - USB 2.0
  - Leds (red and green)
  - /proc/cpuinfo : ep93xx cpu revision & uniq ID

  TS-72xx SBCs
  ------------
  - Console LCD text driver (LCD 2x7 header)
  - Cpufreq driver (configured for ep9301, not tested with ep9302)
  - Input matrix keypad driver (DIO header)
  - Watchdog (CPLD of TS-7200)
  - PATA support: TS-7200 CF
  - Max197 option (platform driver)
  - TMP124 spi slave driver
  - Flash mapping driver for 8mo NOR flash (physmap mapping driver can be used too)
  - /proc/driver/sbcinfo : some infos about TS-72XX sbc

  PC/104 peripherals
  -----------------
  - TS-SER1 support [/dev/ttyS0]
  - TS-9600: PATA support and legacy IDE support
  - TS-5620 (RTC daughterboard for TS-7200) support
  - TS-ETH100 support


Notes
=====
This patch reuse previous work for kernel 2.6.24.4.
Motivation was mainly for having generic GPIO layer.
Memory management is still using ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE. Moving to ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE is in progress.

Had to fix nearly all drivers with new GPIO API calls and "asm/mach" include paths.
Individual patches are provided. Cumulative patch is still there.

Warning: Concerning "Floating point emulation"
  FlastFPE math selection hangs ("Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!")
  NWFPE math emulation works correctly. Didn't take time to dig that (eabi/oabi stuff?)

For TS-72XX machines, I2C pins are hardcoded to be on DIO 2x8 header: DIO_6 for sda and DIO_7 for scl.
